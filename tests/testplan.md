#Test Plan

##Categories of Testing
There are several basic categories of testing that I'm interested in:

* Ordinary correct operation, such as CRUD operations.

	I will call every URL I can enumerate. I want to verify basic screen content.

* What happens with bad inputs ?  SQL injection?

	Can I trigger validation messages?

* After all of the above, what does code coverage look like?

* How do I know that routing works correctly?

	Do all possible routes go somewhere?

	Can some urls get past routing and invoke SkyNet?

* Run db test scenarios.

* Does the html output adhere to standards?

##Fixture Data

Much testing involves the db. This is a notoriously difficult thing to test.  Here I describe my
approach.  But first a quick review:

We are using PHPUnit and IntegrationTestCase from CakePHP.  This requires a 'test' db configuration
in app.config.  When this runs, it will drop all the tables, if any, presently in the test db,
and create new ones, based on the fixtures specified in the test case.  This presents two obvious
issues: 1) Where to obtain/specify the schema for the required tables, and 2) where to actually
get the data.

If we specify the schema in the fixtures we would have to manually keep it in sync with everything
else and it definitely doesn't participate in the Cake migration process.  It is however easy 
to tell Cake testing to use the schema from another db, such as perhaps from myapp-dev,
by setting the $import member in a fixture class.  Hopefully this schema is more elegantly kept in synch
with everything else and would be a good source to copy. This will give us the schema, but not the data.

Getting the data is the hard part.  Here we have two basic choices: 1) Hard-wire example data in 
the fixture files, or 2) import from another db (as with the schema).  These choices are confounded
by the fact that realistic example data will include many records that are all intricately
wired together via their keys.  

We need to carefully ensure that there is sufficient variation
in order to exercise all the nooks and crannies of our code. For example, a list of classes for one
teacher should not display classes for another. To make sure this is not happening, we need to
have records refering to both teachers, and ensure that only the proper subset is used. In fact
I suggest that explicitly testing for this variation is desireable.  So for example, our list 
of records in one screen is known to be the desired subset, filtered from other records, instead
of all records, that just don't have sufficient variation.

We need some method of obtaining bad records.  We'll need something to trigger the various exceptions
and validations.

During testing we eventually need a fairly large db-style capacity for dealing with the
data.  For example, we need WHERE and ORDER clauses, we need to do joins, and we need to use
aggregate functions.  This is not real easy to do using hard-wired fixture data and looks quite
a lot like re-inventing wheels.

All that hand-wringing said, here's my approach:

1. Most of the fixture data lives in a db named myapp-fixture.  This is a showcase for perfect
data only.  Nothing in this db should violate any validation or constraint.



##Cheat Sheet
Execute phpunit.  Feed it whatever args you want...
cd $STACK_ROOT/html/acctwerx
$STACK_ROOT/php/bin/php vendor/bin/phpunit tests/TestCase/Controller

http://localhost/myapp?XDEBUG_SESSION_START=n
var_dump($n);
export XDEBUG_CONFIG="idekey=PHPSTORM"


 * In these tests I generally want to test that:
 *
 * 1. A controller method exists...
 *
 * 2. Said method returns the correct response code.
 *
 * 3. Said method does or does not redirect.  If it redirects, then where to?
 *
 * 4. A bare minimum of html structure required to reasonably verify correct operation
 *    and to facilitate TDD.  For example, the add method should return a form with certain fields,
 *    and particular <A> tag should exist.
 *
 * 5. Verify that the db has changed as expected, if applicable.
 *
 * 6. Whether or not Auth prevents/allows access to a method.
 *
 * I do not want to test (here):
 *
 * 1. How the method responds to badly formed requests, such as trying to submit a DELETE to the add method.
 *
 * 2. Any html structure, formatting, css, scripts, tags, krakens, or whatever, beyond the bare minimum
 *    listed above.
 *
 * 3. Whether or not following an <A> tag actually works as expected.
 *
 * These items should be tested elsewhere.
 *
 * Although tempting to test for viewVars, resist the urge.  If they are not set correctly then
 * there will be actual consequences that the testing will catch.  At best looking for viewVars
 * is a debugging aid.  At worst, we'll eat a lot of time picking them apart.  Just say No.
 *
 * Input control validation:
 *
 * There are several methods of verifying that a particular input or select control
 * is correct.  For example, we may want to search for a control based on its id or name, may want
 * to ensure that it's blank or has some particular value.  Perhaps the control should be of a
 * certain type such as 'text' or 'hidden', or perhaps a select control should be set to a particular
 * selection or 'no selection'.  If we're not careful, these variations can give rise to a blizzard
 * of similar methods, that operate in a similar, but inconsitent manner.  But because we _are_ careful,
 * we've abstracted all this out in a reasonably sensible manner.  Here's how it works...
 *
 * Each attribute about a control of interest can be described using a simple css selector string.
 *
 *
 * A. The control exists and can be found using a css finder string., is of some given type, and has a specified value.
 * B. The input is a select, with a given css finder string, and has a specified value.
